# tokenizer

A test token was deployed via the frontend in this repo, but it can also be used to deploy any other tokens.

Token name: 42 Altarian
Blockchain: Solana

This tokeniser is built on Anchor and calls SPL and metaplex SDKs to mint the tokens. A custom logic for multisig has been added that will be handled from the frontend.
